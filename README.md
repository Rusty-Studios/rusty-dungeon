## Description
A 2D game written using Rust and Bevy Game Engine, in which the player has to shoot and defeat enemies on their way to the final boss.
The game is heavily inspired by "[The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)".
The battle system is based on shooting – just like in the original game where tha player fights with their tears as a weapon. 

The main goal of this project for us was to get familiar with Rust and Bevy.
